# Dominion UENP - AtoM custom theme

This theme is created based in theme Dominion (arDominionPlugin) default AtoM theme, the theme customization was made for use in the Historical Documentation Center project [Centro de Documentação Histórica - CEDHIS](http://atom.uenp.edu.br).

We track your content with git and publish it to a GitHub repository so we can allow others to reference it in their own AtoM project. The repository is public and the theme is open source so you can use it for your own reference, giving you the freedom to study, modify, improve, and distribute it.
